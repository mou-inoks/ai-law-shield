# 🛡️ AI Law Shield - Your AI-Powered Contract Guardian 🚨

Welcome to **AI Law Shield**, your new best friend when it comes to reading those boring and confusing contracts, privacy policies, and terms of service! 🕵️‍♂️📄

Do you ever find yourself scrolling through endless legal text and just clicking "Accept" because... who has time for that? 😅 Well, worry no more! AI Law Shield uses **Artificial Intelligence** to analyze contracts in seconds, detect shady clauses, and give you a summary of all the critical points you need to know before signing your life away! 💀✍️

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Analyze Contracts**: Just upload your contract, and let the AI do the heavy lifting!
- ⚠️ **Detect Abusive Clauses**: AI Law Shield will highlight sections that might be a bit... *sus* 👀.
- 🚦 **Risk Levels**: Get a danger rating from 1️⃣ (all good) to 5️⃣ (RUN!).
- 📊 **Detailed Annotations**: See exactly which parts of the contract raised red flags.
- 🌐 **Coming Soon**: Browser extension for real-time analysis on any website! 🖥️

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to protect yourself from legal traps? Let's set you up! 🧑‍💻

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-law-shield.git
   cd ai-law-shield
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the contract analysis**:
    ```bash
    python contract_analyzer.py --analyze examples/new_contract.txt
   ```

## 📂Project Structure
    ```bash
        ai-law-shield/
        ├── contract_analyzer.py    # Main AI analysis script
        ├── dataset/                # Folder containing training datasets
        ├── models/                 # Trained AI models saved here

        └── tests/                  # Unit tests for our AI (we want it to be smart, not rogue 🤖)
    ```

## 💡 How It Works
The AI Law Shield uses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand contracts better than your average lawyer (okay, maybe not better, but definitely faster!). It classifies clauses into levels of risk and provides annotations on what could be risky for you. 🧐

Don't forget when looking at the code that i am not an engeener with 10 years of experience, my main goal is to create a project to learn ai.
